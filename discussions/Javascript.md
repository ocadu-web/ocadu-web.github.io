## Javascript

Current version: ES6/2015
*Discussion: [What does this all mean?][1] [Differences between ES5 and ES6][2]

Topics to Learn:
- Javascript Variables
- Javascript Functions
- Data Structures
- Arrays and Sets
- Node.js and Server Side Scripting
- NPM


#### Data Structures
Accessing, inserting, deleting, finding, and sorting the data are some of the well-known operations that one can perform using data structures.

- [Arrays][3]
- [Stacks][4]
- Queues
- [Linked List][5]
- Hash Tables
- Trees
- Graphs

[Sets:][6] Sets were introduced to the specification in ES6. A set is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot include any duplicate values. They are similar in concept to a mathematical set5, although (for the time being at least) they don’t contain mathematical set operations such as union, intersection and product. 


#### Node
[Node.js][7] is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications with JavaScript.

_Discussion: [What exactly is Node.js?][8]_

[NPM:][9] Use npm to install, share, and distribute code; manage dependencies in your projects; and share & receive feedback with others.

_npm is lots of things._
_- npm is the package manager for Node.js. It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code._
_- The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community._
_- npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages._
_- npm, Inc. is the company that hosts and maintains all of the above._



#### Exercises:
- Setup a Node.js REPL session
- Compare REPL to the javascript console
