## Digital Architecture


"Digital architecture does not just represent 'ideated space'; it also creates places for human interaction that do not resemble physical architectural spaces."

- One of the most sophisticated examples of digital architecture is virtual reality.
- Digital architecture is not only a series of representations of an ideated space, but als serves as a metaphor in the creation of places on the internet and the web.
- Architecture in this sense is meant for the creation of place for human interaction, which may not resemble physical architectural places.

The concept that is fundamental to any type of representation is *mapping*.  Which is essential to not only the creation of a data space, but essential to the ability to navigate it.

This is the image I want to leave you with when approaching the learning of web systems design.
