  <h3 class="sassy">Course Description</h3>
  <p>In this course you will be exposed to new concepts relevant to the growing pace of the web. Students will begin to build a working knowledge privy to the user experience designer, front-end web developer and an understanding of the back-end web developer. As graduate artists, designers, and researchers, students in Digital Futures will thrive in a <b>“learn how to learn”</b> approach to the subject matter. Understanding core concepts that are current in digital thinking are taught and applied from the first day until the end of the course cycle. The course will encourage the knowing of the basics <b>(HTML5, CSS, and ES6 Javascript)</b>, and position you to make advanced level decisions that will apply your skills well beyond the scope of the web industry. Web designers know the value of design, but must know how this can be articulated to those outside of the industry. That know-how begins here, whether preparing for the job market, or for exhibiting your work. No previous knowledge of the web will be required to take this course, beginners will get a thorough training, and experienced students will be challenged with more advanced topics.

  <h3 class="sassy">Instructor</h3>
  <p>Marcus A. Gordon brings work experience from various organizations in the computing, finance, and telecommunications sectors. At OCAD University, he is an advocate for open source and digital literacy, and promotes this via the Visual Analytics Labs' industry and academic relationships he builds there as lab manager. His recent MFA graduate research in 2017 combined his interests in holography, photography and architecture, exploring the nature of spatial imaging and public art. In the summer of 2017, he completed his Digital Futures studies and research assistance with an internship at IBM Design. Marcus also continues his art research practice in holography through OCAD University's PHASE Lab, alongside his passion for fine art photography. In 2018, Marcus is the newest member of The Toronto Public Library's Innovation Council, and continues to advocate digital thinking in art/design research and education.
